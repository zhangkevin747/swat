Although there is evidence linking mental health issues to transgender experiences, this association is not universal. In fact, many transgender individuals report experiencing symptoms of mental health problems, such as anxiety, depression, and trauma, but do not meet the diagnostic criteria for a mental illness. Some studies suggest that transgender individuals may have a higher risk of developing mental health issues, but this risk is not universal. It is essential to note that mental health support is crucial for transgender individuals, and trans-inclusive healthcare policies and resources can help improve mental health outcomes for transgender people.",
